I can't even remember how this works. But I do remember what I had hoped to do ...

## The Plan

* Make an effectively infinite canvas on a Web Page.
* You can draw on that canvas and everything you draw is saved as vector information with a timestamp.
* Just keep going, forever ...

## But there's a twist

* When you start, you need to enter the alphabet in your neatest handwriting. After that, the program guesses when it thinks you've written a letter and annotates it.
* You can make corrections, and that refines the model.

So now, you have an infinite bit of paper which you can hand write on and it 
knows about letters. I'm hoping that it's got the sense to recognise lines of 
text, etc.

Great! You can search this for words and go back and forward in time to see 
what you were doing. Obviously, pictures and diagrams are fine too.

I'd hoped that this could turn into a sort of written diary of the future, 
one which would work nicely on pad type devices with pen interface but with all the added benefits of text.

Of course, it would be even more cute if there was an embeded API and scripting languge ... "show me what I wrote last week" [Execute]
